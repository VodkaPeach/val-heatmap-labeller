# Valorant engagement labeller

## Motivation

@Ominousx created [valorgrids](https://github.com/Ominousx/valorgrids): a heatmap tool to analyse activity patterns. Users need to supply a CSV file that labels various engagement data points (kills, deaths, etc.) on a predefined 10x10 grid system. The purpose of the web app is to expedite the labelling process by providing an interactive interface.

## How to use

On the left menu:

1. Choose Map
2. Choose Mode (Drag & zoom/mark kills/mark deaths)
3. Press the save button once done labelling
4. Download CSV output

Refer to [valorgrids](https://github.com/Ominousx/valorgrids) on how to use the heatmap tool.

## Features to be added

1. filter
2. delete data points
3. preview CSV
4. support other data types
